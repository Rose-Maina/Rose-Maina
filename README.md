👋 Hi, I am Rose Maina

I’m not a full-time developer — I just like to explore code when inspiration strikes. 

GitHub is my digital notebook for experiments, practice projects, and “what if?” ideas.  

🔭 I occasionally work on:
  - Small utilities that make life easier  
  - Following along with tutorials and courses  
  - Testing out new programming languages  

🌱 Currently curious about: [HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQLite, and PostgreSQL]  
📚 Always learning, always experimenting.  

If you stumble across something useful here, AWESOME!
